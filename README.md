## Reflection

This is a one-week-long task project given as as a part of a selection process for a Entry level Software Developer Role at Avanera.

I started the development process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize the initial setup, then installed `yarn`.

The main challenge I faced while developing this app was using the `recoil` state management tool. As I had not previously used this tool, it took me longer to comprehend the main concepts of it, but despite the affords I ended up having issues while using this tool and I eventually decided not to use `recoil` for this app. Additionally, I might also use alternative state management tools like `redux` or `context`, but due to project time constraints i had to focus more on app performance and functionality rather than using better tools.

Another challenge I ran into was sorting by date and name. I tried to optimize my solution for this feature and spent relatively more amount of time than needed to better and shorten my code.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, hooks, styled-components and significant amount of JSX and CSS.
